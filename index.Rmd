The following problems from the textbook are due Friday, 9/29. Hand in solutions at beginning of class.  All of the following are from Chapter 3:

* 6
* 16, 19, 29
* 55, 61
* 71, 85, 86, 87
* 108 (use `dhyper()` or similar function in `R` to solve)

* 202, 212, 213, 215

Notes:

* For 16, specify the pmf of $Y$.
* 29 has a typo; the equation should read $E(Y) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty P(Y\geq i)$
