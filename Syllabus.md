##Course summary

STAT 450 and 460 are courses in mathematical statistics intended for upper-level undergraduate students in the mathematical sciences. The goal in STAT 450 is provide a solid foundation in the theory of random variables, probability distributions, and convergence in probability and distribution. The successful student in STAT 460 will leave the course with a basic understanding of many of the important foundational concepts in statistical inference, namely estimation (with confidence) and hypothesis testing. In addition, students will be comfortable using a wide variety of mathematical tools for solving statistical inference problems. 

Along the way, students will also become adept at using R to investigate and solve statistical problems.  

## Course text

The required text for this course is Mathematical Statistics with Applications by Wackerly, Mendenhall, & Scheaffer, 7th edition (WMS7).  Students may share copies of this book, although students planning on continuing to graduate school are encouraged to have their own copy.

##  Statistical computing

We will use the open-source R programming language extensively throughout this course, both in the course notes and through regular R-specific assignments.  Some R-related resources are below.  If you have no experience with R (or even if you do), I highly recommend you look at some of the below tutorials.  Those who have some experience in R are recommended to jump straight to the tutorial on loops and if/else statements, as this kind of coding logic will be prevalent in this course.  

  * <a href=https://cran.r-project.org/> Base R  </a> 
  * <a href=https://www.rstudio.com/home/>  R Studio </a> 
  * <a href=http://tryr.codeschool.com/levels/1/challenges/1>  Interactive introduction to basic R </a> 
  * <a href=http://scc.stat.ucla.edu/page_attachments/0000/0093/Intermediate_R_2_09S.pdf> Nice powerpoint on loops and if/else statements </a>...try some of the code yourself!
  * <a href=https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf> ggplot2 cheat sheet </a> (I use this ALL THE TIME) 
  * <a href=https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf> R Markdown cheat sheet </a> 

## Assignments

Your final grade will be determined based on the following criteria:

<b> Homework (50%): </b>  Homework will be comprised of two parts
  1. <em> Theoretical problems: </em> These will primarily be problems assigned from WMS7.  Students are encouraged, but not required, to submit these homework solutions using R Markdown/LaTeX.  
  2. <em> Investigative problems: </em> In addition to the theoretical problems, there will be regular problems that require the use of R to investigate some aspect of the content covered in class.    


<b> Midterm exam (25%): </b> The Midterm exam will likely comprise both an in-class and take-home portion, with the in-class involving more theoretical problems and the take-home more computational problems.  

<b> Final exam (25%): </b> Similar to the Midterm, the Final exam will likely comprise both an in-class and take-home portion, with the in-class involving more theoretical problems and the take-home more computational problems.  

## Using GitHub for assignment submission

Students will be required, to submit solutions to "Investigative problems" using the following techniques:

1. Create a GitHub account
2. Create a repository for Stat 450/60 assignments
2. Add me as a collaborator to this repository
3. Submit a knited file with solutions to each assignment, as it is assigned (assignments will be posted in this GitHub repository).  

For more details on creating a GitHub account, repository, and a demonstration of submitting an assignment, watch <a href=https://mediaspace.mnscu.edu/media/GitHub+Tutorial/0_zzd0qgi6> this tutorial video </a>.


<b>  Note that your GitHub repository is public; implying there's nothing stopping you from copying/pasting each other's solutions.  I encourage you to work and troubleshoot together; however, ALL CODE YOU SUBMIT AS YOUR OWN SHOULD BE WRITTEN BY YOU!</b>   The midterm and final will contain programming problems that you will be <b> <em>very stuck</em> </b>  on if you are not doing your own work throughout the semester.  
# Academic dishonesty will result in 0 on all relevant assignments. #
If in doubt as to whether something is academic dishonesty, ask.
